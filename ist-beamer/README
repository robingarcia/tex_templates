This file explains how to use the IST layout style for latex-beamer presentations.

Check if you can directly use ist-beamer: Enter the command 'kpsewhich beamerthemeiststyle.sty',
and if you get an output, you can probably directly use the IST style with latex-beamer.

Otherwise, an easy way to get access to all packages required for ist-beamer is to create
a symbolic link to /home/ist/TeX/tex/ in your local texmf directory:
ln -s /home/ist/TeX/tex/ ~/texmf/ist-packages
mktexlsr 

After that, 'kpsewhich beamerthemeiststyle.sty' should give the output
/home/ist/TeX/tex/ist-beamer/beamerthemeiststyle.sty

Then, you are ready to create your presentation with latex-beamer as usual. As a starting
point, you can e.g. use the example provided in the ist-beamer directory.

Converting from DVI to PDF:
Usually, you want your presentation as PDF file. For some TeX-Installations (like the one
on the computer at IST that I mostly use), the usual way via dvips and ps2pdf does not
really work. Therefore, I added the shell script convert_to_pdf.sh. If your DVI file has
the name mytalk.dvi, than calling 'convert_to_pdf.sh mytalk' in your working directory creates 
the presentation file as mytalk.pdf. I hope either the usual way or this script work on all
computers at IST.

NEWS & CHANGES

2007-07-11
If you do not like the navigation symbols inserted near the footline of every slide, just
use the command
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}
somewhere in the preamble of the Latex document.

2008-06-27
A reasonable default footline is created by using the command
\setbeamertemplate{footlinetext}[shorttitle]
somewhere in the preamble of the Latex document.

Frame numbers can be shown in the foot line, either by using the command
\setbeamertemplate{framenumber}[show]
for showing the current frame number on each slide, or with
\setbeamertemplate{framenumber}[showtotal]
for showing also the total frame number.
The first frame (usually the title page) is not counted, and no numbers are displayed on it.
By default, no frame numbers are shown.

The footline text is no longer shown on the first slide. I wanted to remove the logo too, but
this created problems with positioning the footline correctly on further slides, so the
logo is now still shown on the first slide.
